# Diagnosing Parkinson’s Disease using voice sample data analysis
# Context
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive movement disorder of the nervous system, according to the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Common symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Notable individuals affected include Muhammad Ali, George H.W. Bush, Michael J. Fox, Ozzy Osbourne, and Pope John Paul II.
There is no cure or specific diagnostic test for PD; existing methods like blood tests and brain scans are invasive and stressful. Increasing research focuses on non-invasive diagnosis through speech analysis, as people with PD often experience dysphonia—reduced loudness, breathiness, roughness, and vocal tremors—detectable via voice frequency patterns.
# Objective

# Methodology
In this assignment, I explore voice sample data from early-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients to uncover patterns and make predictions. My methodology consists of three main stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conduct an in-depth examination of the data’s structure and patterns using both descriptive and inferential statistics.
2. **Data Visualisation:** I create graphical representations to highlight complex relationships and strengthen data storytelling.
3. **Predictive Modelling:** I build and refine models to predict UPDRS scores through:

   * Basic Linear Regression
   * Log-Transformation and Collinearity Analysis
   * Gaussian Transformation
   * Model rebuilding after each transformation

My objective is to determine the most effective predictive model to support the development of PD diagnostic techniques using voice sample analysis.
